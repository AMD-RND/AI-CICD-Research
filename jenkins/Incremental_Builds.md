## 1. Introduction

Incremental builds are a powerful optimization that allows Jenkins to build only the parts of a project that have changed, rather than rebuilding everything from scratch. This guide covers the concepts, tools, and best practices for implementing incremental builds in Jenkins.

## 2. Why Incremental Builds?

- **Faster Build Times:** Only changed modules are rebuilt, saving time.
- **Efficient Resource Usage:** Reduces CPU, memory, and storage consumption.
- **Scalability:** Supports large monorepos and modular projects.
- **Developer Productivity:** Faster feedback cycles for code changes.

## 3. How Incremental Builds Work

Incremental builds rely on detecting changes in source code, dependencies, or configuration, and then building only the affected components. This can be achieved through:
- File checksums or timestamps
- Dependency graphs
- Build tool support (e.g., Gradle, Bazel, Make)

## 4. Tools and Plugins for Incremental Builds

- **Gradle:** Built-in incremental build support
- **Bazel:** Advanced dependency analysis and caching
- **Maven:** Incremental builds with plugins
- **Jenkins Plugins:** Pipeline, Matrix, and custom scripts

## 5. Setting Up Incremental Builds in Jenkins

### Example: Gradle Incremental Build
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh './gradlew build'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Gradle automatically detects changes and only rebuilds affected modules.

### Example: Bazel Incremental Build
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'bazel build //...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Bazel uses a dependency graph to determine what needs to be rebuilt.

### Example: Custom Script for Incremental Build
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Detect Changes') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def changed = sh(script: 'git diff --name-only HEAD~1', returnStdout: true).trim().split('\n')
                    if (changed.contains('module-a/')) {
                        build job: 'Module-A-Build'
                    }
                    if (changed.contains('module-b/')) {
                        build job: 'Module-B-Build'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 6. Real-World Examples

- **Monorepos:** Build only changed services or libraries.
- **Microservices:** Trigger builds for affected services based on code changes.
- **Large Applications:** Use dependency graphs to minimize rebuilds.

## 7. Advanced Incremental Build Techniques

- **Change Impact Analysis:** Use tools to analyze which modules are affected by a change.
- **Distributed Builds:** Run incremental builds across multiple agents.
- **Artifact Caching:** Cache build outputs for reuse in future builds.
- **Partial Test Execution:** Run only tests affected by code changes.

## 8. Best Practices

- **Reliable Change Detection:** Use robust methods (e.g., checksums, dependency graphs).
- **Consistent Build Environments:** Ensure agents have the same configuration.
- **Clear Logging:** Log which modules were rebuilt and why.
- **Documentation:** Document incremental build logic in your Jenkinsfile.

## 9. Troubleshooting Incremental Builds

- **Missed Changes:** Ensure all dependencies are tracked.
- **Stale Artifacts:** Clean up old build outputs regularly.
- **Plugin Compatibility:** Keep build tools and plugins up to date.
- **Debugging:** Add verbose logging for change detection steps.

## 10. Integrating with Other Jenkins Features

- **Pipeline Libraries:** Share incremental build logic across projects.
- **Parallel Builds:** Combine incremental and parallel builds for maximum speed.
- **Notifications:** Alert developers when incremental builds are triggered.

## 11. Security Considerations

- **Artifact Integrity:** Verify cached artifacts to prevent tampering.
- **Access Control:** Restrict who can modify incremental build logic.
- **Audit Logging:** Track changes to build scripts and configurations.

## 12. Performance Tuning

- **Optimize Change Detection:** Use efficient algorithms for large codebases.
- **Agent Scaling:** Add more agents to handle distributed incremental builds.
- **Cache Management:** Monitor and tune cache size and eviction policies.

## 13. Case Studies

- **Enterprise Monorepo:** Reduced build times by 80% using incremental builds.
- **Open Source Project:** Improved contributor experience with faster feedback.

## 14. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q:** How do I know which modules to rebuild?
  **A:** Use dependency analysis tools or custom scripts.
- **Q:** Can I combine incremental and parallel builds?
  **A:** Yes, for even greater speed.
- **Q:** What if a dependency changes?
  **A:** Ensure your change detection logic includes dependencies.
