# Zero Downtime Deployment Strategies (v0.0.1 → v0.0.2)

Zero-downtime deployment ensures that your application remains available to users while upgrading from v0.0.1 to v0.0.2. Below are the most common strategies to achieve this:

---

## 1. Blue-Green Deployment 💙💚

- **Two Environments:** Maintain two identical environments: "Blue" (live, v0.0.1) and "Green" (new, v0.0.2).
- **Deploy & Test:** Deploy v0.0.2 to "Green" and run all necessary tests.
- **Switch Traffic:** Update the load balancer to route all traffic to "Green" once ready.
- **Rollback:** If issues arise, revert traffic to "Blue".
- **Decommission:** Shut down or repurpose "Blue" after successful migration.

**Benefits:**
- Simple rollback
- Minimal risk
- Easy to understand and implement

## 2. Canary Deployment 🐤

- **Deploy Canary:** Release v0.0.2 to a small subset of users while v0.0.1 remains live.
- **Partial Traffic:** Configure the load balancer to send 5-10% of traffic to v0.0.2.
- **Monitor:** Observe performance, error rates, and user feedback.
- **Gradual Rollout:** Increase traffic to v0.0.2 incrementally until it serves all users.
- **Decommission:** Remove v0.0.1 after full rollout.

**Benefits:**
- Limits risk to a small user group
- Real-world testing before full release

---

## 3. Rolling Deployment 🔄

- **Instance-by-Instance:** Remove one server running v0.0.1 from rotation.
- **Update:** Upgrade it to v0.0.2 and re-add to the load balancer.
- **Repeat:** Continue until all servers run v0.0.2.

**Benefits:**
- No downtime
- Continuous availability

## Summary

All these strategies allow for seamless upgrades with no downtime, ensuring user experience is uninterrupted. Choose the method that best fits your infrastructure and risk tolerance.
