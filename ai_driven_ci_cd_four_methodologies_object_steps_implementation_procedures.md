# AIâ€‘Driven CI/CD â€” Four Methodologies
**Scope:** Procedureâ€‘only, stepâ€‘byâ€‘step implementation plans derived from our previous design for a Jenkins + Multiâ€‘OS (ARM/Linux/Windows) pipeline with progressive delivery, anomaly detection, autoâ€‘rollback, and continuous learning. **No code** included.

---

## Methodology 1: AIâ€‘Driven Adaptive Deployment Architecture (Jenkins + Multiâ€‘OS)

### Objectives
- Automatically select **canary / blueâ€‘green / rolling** strategy per change.
- Orchestrate deployments across **ARM, Linux (K8s), Windows (IIS/services)**.
- Capture decision evidence and publish to **Artifactory Buildâ€‘Info**.

### Inputs
- Git change metadata (diff, LOC, files, deps, coverage delta)
- Historical success/rollback stats
- Current traffic/load & business calendar

### Outputs
- Chosen strategy + rollout pace (% weights or batches)
- Deployment status (promoted/paused/rolled back)
- Evidence bundle (metrics snapshots, decisions, links)

### Procedure (Implementation Steps)
1. **Establish Environments & Targets**
   - Define prod/stage clusters (K8s), Windows pools/sites, ARM cohorts.
   - Catalog services and OS support matrix.
2. **Define Strategy Policies**
   - Thresholds for **riskâ†’strategy** mapping (Rolling < Canary < Blue/Green).
   - Allowed time windows; change freeze rules.
3. **Collect Decision Signals**
   - Standardize metrics labels (RED/USE) and user KPIs.
   - Normalize Jenkins build/test outcomes and dependency changes.
4. **Risk Scoring (Heuristic v1)**
   - Weight LOC, dep bumps, critical modules, past failure rate, coverage delta.
   - Produce `risk_score` 0â€“100; persist with the build record.
5. **Select Strategy & Pace**
   - Map scoreâ†’strategy; define pace schedule (e.g., 10â†’25â†’50â†’100 or Blue/Green cutover gate).
6. **Wire Orchestrators**
   - K8s: prepare Helm/Argo Rollouts/Flagger specs.
   - Windows: prepare Blue/Green slots, ARR/LB weights.
   - ARM: define OTA cohorts and promotion rules.
7. **Gate with Observability**
   - Preâ€‘deploy smoke checks; ensure metrics/alerts present for each service.
8. **Execute & Record**
   - Run the selected strategy; record decisions, windows, SLO status.
9. **Finalize & Publish**
   - On success: promote to 100%, tag **latest** in Artifactory; on failure: mark rollback and freeze.
10. **Review & Tune**
   - Weekly review of risk thresholds vs. outcomes; adjust mappings and paces.

### Success Criteria
- <2% unexpected rollbacks; >30% reduction in mean deploy time; full decision evidence attached to artifacts.

## Methodology 2: Realâ€‘Time Monitoring with Anomaly Detection

### Objectives
- Detect regressions during rollout in **minutes**.
- Produce a **verdict**: promote / slow / rollback.

### Inputs
- Metrics (error rate, p95/p99 latency, CPU/memory, throughput)
- Logs (error signatures, new patterns)
- Traces (error spans, slow endpoints)
- Baseline from last stable release (same timeâ€‘ofâ€‘day if seasonal)

### Outputs
- Windowâ€‘byâ€‘window health status
- Anomaly score + SLO compliance
- Action recommendation (promote/slow/rollback) with reasons

### Procedure (Implementation Steps)
1. **Standardize Telemetry**
   - Instrument apps with OpenTelemetry; ensure consistent labels.
   - Enable exporters for K8s (kubeâ€‘state, cAdvisor), Windows (IIS/Win exporters), ARM beacons.
2. **Define SLOs & Windows**
   - Set service SLOs (e.g., error<1%, p95<300ms); choose window length (1â€“2m) and required consecutive passes.
3. **Create Baselines**
   - Snapshot metrics for the last stable version; align to comparable load periods.
4. **Recording Rules & Alerts**
   - Create summarized series (error ratio, latency quantiles, CPU/mem utilization).
5. **Anomaly Methods (Phaseâ€‘in)**
   - Phase 1: thresholds + EWMA smoothing.
   - Phase 2: baseline zâ€‘scores; seasonal decomposition (STL).
   - Phase 3: multiâ€‘metric outlier detection (Isolation Forest) for hard drifts.
6. **Decision Policy**
   - Encode promote/slow/rollback based on SLO + anomaly results and risk level.
7. **Integrate with Rollouts**
   - Connect analysis steps to rollout gates (K8s AnalysisTemplates, Jenkins stages, Windows checks).
8. **Evidence & Notifications**
   - Store verdicts, plots, and links; notify Slack/Jira with context and runbook.
9. **Shadow Period**
   - Run detection in observeâ€‘only mode; measure false positives/negatives.
10. **Enforce**
   - Activate gating once shadow metrics are acceptable; review monthly.

### Success Criteria
- Median detection time < 5m; falseâ€‘positive rate < 10%; no undetected critical regressions.

## Methodology 3: Autoâ€‘Rollbacks & Selfâ€‘Healing

### Objectives
- Reduce blast radius via **fast, safe reversion**.
- Automatically fix common infra/app issues without human intervention.

### Inputs
- Anomaly verdicts; SLO breaches; health checks
- Catalog of **idempotent playbooks** per platform (K8s, Windows, ARM)
- Lastâ€‘knownâ€‘good versions and configs

### Outputs
- Completed rollback actions (version/traffic/capacity)
- Executed selfâ€‘healing actions with status
- Audit trail and freeze conditions when necessary

### Procedure (Implementation Steps)
1. **Define Rollback Policies**
   - Criteria by stage (% traffic) and severity; freeze rules postâ€‘rollback.
2. **Catalog Playbooks**
   - K8s (abort/promo to stable, helm rollback, restart, HPA/VPA), Windows (slot swap, ARR weight, AppPool restart), ARM (cohort revert, exclude devices).
3. **Establish Safety**
   - Idempotency, locks per service, exponential backoff, and caps on retries.
4. **Wire Controllers**
   - Create discrete rollback and selfâ€‘healing controllers invoked by CD gates.
5. **Config & Schema Safety**
   - Maintain LKG configs; apply expand/contract for DB migrations; use feature flags for risky paths.
6. **Verification**
   - Postâ€‘action checks (health endpoints, KPIs) before unfreezing or reâ€‘promoting.
7. **Evidence & Comms**
   - Persist decisions, timestamps, affected cohorts/nodes; autoâ€‘open incident tickets with links.
8. **Chaos & Drills**
   - Regular game days to validate automation; update runbooks from findings.
9. **Governance**
   - Review rollbacks weekly; prune ineffective playbooks; refine thresholds.

### Success Criteria
- MTTR reduction > 50%; rollback correctness ~100%; no repeated incident without runbook update.

## Methodology 4: Continuous Learning from Logs â†’ Pipeline Efficiency

### Objectives
- Turn operational data into **policy improvements** that speed up builds, tests, and safer deployments.

### Inputs
- Jenkins build/test outcomes, durations, cache hits
- Deploy decisions & outcomes (promote/slow/rollback)
- Observability metrics; log templates; trace errors
- Artifact metadata & security scans

### Outputs
- Updated policies: risk thresholds, test/build selection, rollout pacing
- Flaky test quarantine lists; cache optimization guidance
- Governance reports and dashboards

### Procedure (Implementation Steps)
1. **Ingestion & Normalization**
   - Consolidate logs/metrics/build data into a unified schema (parquet in object store).
2. **Feature Store Setup**
   - Create offline/online features (LOC, dep bumps, fanout, flakiness, cacheability, early anomaly scores).
3. **Define Targets & KPIs**
   - Predictors for failure/rollback; objectives for time saved, precision/recall, falseâ€‘skip caps.
4. **Train & Evaluate Policies**
   - Train models (risk, test selection, build skip, pacing); evaluate vs rolling baselines.
5. **Shadow Policies**
   - Run counterfactual simulations; compare to status quo without affecting prod.
6. **Controlled Rollout**
   - Canary the policies on subset of repos/services; enable rollback to prior policy version.
7. **Governance & Versioning**
   - Track experiments and register policies; store lineage linking builds, data, and decisions.
8. **Feedback Integration**
   - Feed improved policies back into Methodologies 1â€“3; schedule periodic retraining.
9. **Reporting**
   - Dashboards for CI time saved, defect detection efficiency, rollback rate, canary dwell time, cost per change.

### Success Criteria
- â‰¥25% CI time saved; â‰¥50% less flaky test noise; stable or reduced rollback rate; positive cost trend.
