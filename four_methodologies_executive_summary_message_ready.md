# AI-Driven CI/CD — Executive Summary (Message-Ready)

**TL;DR:** We’re implementing four AI-driven methods to make deployments faster, safer, and self-improving across ARM/Linux/Windows.

—

## 1) Adaptive Deployment (Jenkins + Multi‑OS)
- Build per OS → bundle → **risk score** → auto‑select **Canary / Blue‑Green / Rolling**.
- Guard with SLOs (error, p95, CPU/mem, KPIs).
- Publish decisions + evidence to Artifactory; notify Slack/Jira.

**Outcome:** Safer, faster releases with data‑backed strategy per change.

—

## 2) Real‑Time Monitoring & Anomaly Detection
- OpenTelemetry + Prometheus/Loki/Tempo + Grafana.
- Baseline vs candidate; windowed **promote / slow / rollback** verdicts.
- Start with thresholds+EWMA; add Z‑score/STL/Isolation Forest.

**Outcome:** Regressions caught in minutes, not hours.

—

## 3) Auto‑Rollbacks & Self‑Healing
- Policies: critical SLO breach ⇒ **rollback**; infra flake ⇒ **self‑heal** then retry.
- Playbooks: Argo/Helm (K8s), IIS/ARR (Windows), OTA cohorts (ARM).
- DB safety via expand/contract migrations + feature flags.

**Outcome:** Minimal blast radius, >50% MTTR reduction.

—

## 4) Continuous Learning → Pipeline Efficiency
- Ingest builds/tests/metrics/logs → feature store.
- Train: risk model, test/build selectors, rollout pacing; govern via MLflow.
- Shadow → canary → full policy rollout; weekly/monthly retrain.

**Outcome:** ≥25% CI time saved, fewer flakes, stable rollback rate.

—

## KPIs
- Deploy time ↓, rollback rate ↔/↓, MTTR ↓, CI minutes saved ↑, cache hit % ↑, anomaly false‑positive % ↓.

## Next 30 Days (Phased)
1) Telemetry hygiene + SLOs + artifact evidence.
2) Adaptive strategy + basic anomaly gates (shadow → enforce).
3) Rollback/self‑heal playbooks; staging drills.
4) Start learning loop (flaky quarantine, risk model in shadow).
